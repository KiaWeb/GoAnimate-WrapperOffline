# GoAnimate-WrapperOffline
What I use to animate videos. Credits to https://discord.com/invite/Kf7BzSw for making this.
# Tutorial
Download the source code .zip file, then it's super simple. 
Open `installer.bat` ONCE, then go into Wrapper-Offline folder and open `start-wrapper.bat` to run the app.
Select development version or release version once showed up in `installer.bat.` Then, open `start-wrapper.bat` to run the app every time.
